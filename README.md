# BioinformHer-Mini-Project_2025
This repository contains the answers to the Module 2 Mini Project of the BioinformHer training program.

This project aims to apply basic bioinformatics tools learnt from Module 2 to explore the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene across different species.
